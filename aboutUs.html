            <p id="p1">In 2020, when the world was consumed by a virus, we moved to a farm. We aquired about 10 chickens. If you have not heard of "chicken math", you should google it. Anyways, we added many more birds to the flock. We have also lost many to predators.
            
            This new adventure we are on has been a roller coaster ride for my family. However, I wouldn't trade this life for nothing. It is a great way for me to have my own place to start the post military life.
            
            I have been in school for coding since September of 2020 and this is pretty much where I was hoping to get to with these new skills. I want to start up my business and be able to market our work.
            
            In this site, you will see links at the top and bottom that can guide you around to the features in here. I hope you enjoy my work on the site but also maybe if you are local you would want to purchase some fresh eggs or home grown produce or maybe you want to order one of our Custom Wooden Signs. For now, contact me through my Facebook group, or via LinkedIn. As the site gets more developed I will include a store.</p>
