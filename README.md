The point of this website is to be a final project for a Code Immersives. What it may be is the next chapter in my life as I am moving away from the military life. I will be creating the functionality to a bootstrapped and heavily styled website that will show off the Animals, Eggs, Produce, and last but not least our Custom Wood Signs. Any other wood working projects may be thrown in as well.

As far as the functionality goes, I haven't put much thought into that part yet as I begin with HTML and CSS. I will get the page laid out and then begin with the functionality.

Update: I added a game we made earlier and themed it Donkey Pong. A simple add with bringing over the code and created a simple button on my index.html page. I thought it was a good fun add to the homepage.  

Project is progressing On day 5 of actually working on it. I have made several attempts at API calls. The only one that I have had luck with is the Chart API. Got two days left to turn in a final product....

Sunday Night. (Project Due Tomorrow)
Overall, the whole project turned out ok. I found out that the Plant API which was going to be my focal point. was under going maintenance. I was hoping it to add more with JS and API's but I struggled tremedously with the API's. I went in different directions quite a few times. 

I ended up going with adding the old pong game and customizing a todo list. As well as adding two pages that utilize the CHART API site. Until I can get better at API calls I am going to use what I have for now. 


Home  About Us  Farm Chores   Farm Life   Farm API    Plant API   Resources

Home includes the DONKEY PONG GAME and basically just all the links to each page as well as my personal links which the header and footer will be a trend throughout the pages.

About Us includes a brief scenario of what I am up to here. 

Farm Chores - Home made to do list of my daily chores. It also has the functionality to add items, check them off as completed, and delete the entire list. 

Farm Life - Is a neatly laid out page that would look similar to a collage. 

Farm API - Shows a JS chart that is more for my use than user friendly. However, for my farm style life I am creating, this chart is important to me to track the birds I have and also allows me to update and change the data as I need to. 

Plant API - Has the same functionality as the FARM API but it only pertains to our vegetable garden. It will be used to track the amount of individual plants that we have growing. The API I want to use is undergoing maintenence and I have to unfortunately wait to even fix what I had done wrong with it in the api call before the site went under construction. I was so pumped to use this Trefle API. I will get after it in the future. 

Resources - This hand typed list of Veteran Resources took about as long as the whole project. I typed each one in with the hope that it can save a Veterans life. We lose far too many brothers and sisters to Suicide and other unfortunate ways. Use these resources to get the help you may need. My life has completely changed since almost two years ago and it started with getting help for my own PTSD. I wanted to finish this TERM with something meaningful. Everything I put into this site has great importance to me. Whether it is the skills learned or the theme of my project. Every bit of it was done with a purpose that probably excedes the point of the assignment. I feel like I missed some of the more important points of the assignment due to the API issues and the struggle to chose a direction with the functionality, but I completed this assignment. I will be adding to this as it gets more developed.
