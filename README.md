The point of this website is to be a final project for a Code Immersives. What it may be is the next chapter in my life as I am moving away from the military life. I will be creating the functionality to a bootstrapped and heavily styled website that will show off the Eggs, Produce, and last but not least our Custom Wood Signs. Any other wood working projects may be thrown in as well.

As far as the functionality goes, the main focus will be the ability to create a shopping list to buy our products. I haven't put much thought into that part yet as I begin with HTML and CSS. I will get the page laid out and then begin with the functionality.

Looking to have a clean layout and design.
