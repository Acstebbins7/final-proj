The point of this website is to be a final project for a Code Immersives. What it may be is the next chapter in my life as I am moving away from the military life. I will be creating the functionality to a bootstrapped and heavily styled website that will show off the Eggs, Produce, and last but not least our Custom Wood Signs. Any other wood working projects may be thrown in as well.

As far as the functionality goes, the main focus will be the ability to create a shopping list to buy our products. I haven't put much thought into that part yet as I begin with HTML and CSS. I will get the page laid out and then begin with the functionality.

Update: I added a game we made earlier and themed it Donkey Pong. A simple add with bringing over the code and created a simple button on my index.html page. The game isn't very well done. It works but seeing it now I know it could be improved. That will not be done as I have plenty more to go tackle on this assignment. I thought it was a good fun add to the homepage.  

Project is progressing On day 5 of actually working on it. I have made several attempts at API calls. The only one that I have had luck with is the Chart API. Got two days left to turn in a final product....
